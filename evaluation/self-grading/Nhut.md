# Nhut - Self-Grading

## Self-grade (out of 80)
**80 / 80**

## Justification

### Code quality and organization
- Jobs module implementation is clear and consistent with the project structure:
  - model
  - controllers
  - routes
  - authentication integration for V2
- Code is readable and modular, making it easy for the team to maintain.

### Completion of assigned features
- Fully completed:
  - **Jobs API V1 CRUD**
  - **Comprehensive Jobs tests for V1**
  - **Jobs API V2 route protection**
  - **Jobs auth tests for V2**

### Additional contribution
- Provided meaningful support to the team by helping debug **User/Auth** issues that impacted cross-module integration and testing stability.

### Areas to improve
- If time allowed, I would help standardize error-handling responses across the whole project to make validation status codes more consistent.

## Group grading (out of 40)
**40 / 40**

### Justification
- The team delivered the required V1 and V2 backend features with clear division of responsibilities.
- Jobs and Users/Auth were integrated successfully, and write endpoints were protected correctly in V2.
- The backend test suites provided good coverage for the key requirements.
- Team communication and support during debugging helped stabilize the final implementation.

### Areas to improve
- Standardize error-handling and validation status codes across all modules.
- Add more end-to-end integration tests for cross-module scenarios.
