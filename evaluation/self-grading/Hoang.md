## Score: 75/80

## Justification:

    - Code quality and organization (40/40):
        - The code is modular, separating controllers, routes, and models clearly.
        - Proper use of async/await and error handling ensures stable and maintainable code.
        - RESTful principles are followed, with meaningful status codes and structured JSON responses.
        - Passwords are securely hashed, and JWT is used for authentication.

    - Completion of assigned features (35/40):
        - All CRUD operations for users are implemented and tested.
        - Authentication with registration and login is fully functional.
        - Protected routes correctly enforce access control via middleware.
        - Automated tests cover most normal and edge cases; only minor improvements could be added for rare edge cases or additional input validation.
