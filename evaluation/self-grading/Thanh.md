# Thanh - Self-Grading 

## Self-grade (out of 80)
**80 / 80**
I assess my contributions using common criteria on a 0-80 scale.

1. Functionality — 80
   - Add and Edit job features work as required; LoginPage provides an authentication flow.
   - Minor edge cases (e.g., retries on network failures) are not fully handled.

2. Code Quality — 80
   - Code is clear and components are reasonably separated; errors and loading are handled.
   - Could be improved by refactoring into reusable form components and adding more inline documentation.

3. UX (User Experience) — 80
   - Forms include validation, loading states, and clear error messages.
   - Could be improved further with toasts, success confirmations, and focusing/scrolling to fields with errors.

4. Collaboration & Process — 80
   - Created PRs for features, made logical commits, and collaborated with the team.
   - Can improve by creating smaller, earlier PRs to get faster feedback.

Overall (weighted average) — 80

## Group grading (out of 40)
**40 / 40**

### Justification
- The team delivered the required V1 and V2 backend features with clear division of responsibilities.
- Jobs and Users/Auth were integrated successfully, and write endpoints were protected correctly in V2.
- The backend test suites provided good coverage for the key requirements.
- Team communication and support during debugging helped stabilize the final implementation.

### Areas to improve
- Standardize error-handling and validation status codes across all modules.
- Add more end-to-end integration tests for cross-module scenarios.
