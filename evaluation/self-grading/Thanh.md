# Thanh - Self-Grading 

I assess my contributions using common criteria on a 0-80 scale.

1. Functionality — 80
   - Add and Edit job features work as required; LoginPage provides an authentication flow.
   - Minor edge cases (e.g., retries on network failures) are not fully handled.

2. Code Quality — 80
   - Code is clear and components are reasonably separated; errors and loading are handled.
   - Could be improved by refactoring into reusable form components and adding more inline documentation.

3. UX (User Experience) — 80
   - Forms include validation, loading states, and clear error messages.
   - Could be improved further with toasts, success confirmations, and focusing/scrolling to fields with errors.

4. Collaboration & Process — 80
   - Created PRs for features, made logical commits, and collaborated with the team.
   - Can improve by creating smaller, earlier PRs to get faster feedback.

Overall (weighted average) — 80
